#CAPSTONE PROJECT IDEAS

#Idea #1 – Rental Prices in Seattle (Real Estate Moghul)
Predict how apartment rental prices in Seattle are going to vary in the near future. Will it make sense to buy an apartment building and rent out units as a business opportunity?
Dataset – Use date available from Zillow

#Idea #2 - Superbowl 51 (You Bet!)
Predict the top two teams that will play in Superbowl 51. Use fantasy points and past data for the analysis. Rank the teams by giving weightage points for offense and defense. 
Dataset – Yahoo Fantasy Football, ESPN and NFL.com,
 Kaggle (https://www.kaggle.com/maxhorowitz/nflplaybyplay2009to2016)

#Idea#3 – Tsunamis
Analyze in which part of the world the most tsunamis have occurred. How have they varied over the years? Which regions have faced the deadliest and worst damages? Is there any reason for a particular region to have the most Tsunamis (if applicable)? Can we predict the location of the next tsunami?
